# Swishlist
*Make gift-giving great again*

Jaded from the consumerism of Christmas, I set out to make a website where people could essentially select items they'd like to gift people, completely anonymously.
Turns out, there's 3.2 million wishlist-type websites out there, and I couldn't think of a decent USP. Then [another project came up...](https://github.com/MattRyder/Stocksu)

It's written in ASP.NET MVC 5 (C#).
